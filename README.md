# 🪙 Sentiment Analysis in Cryptocurrency Trading

**Level**: Master's / Doctoral  
**Keywords**: Cryptocurrency, Twitter Sentiment, MATLAB, NLP, Trading Strategy, Time Series

---

## 📌 Objective

To develop optimized cryptocurrency trading strategies by analyzing Twitter sentiment. This project integrates **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**, **Machine Learning**, and **Time Series Modeling** within the **MATLAB** environment to create data-driven, sentiment-informed trading signals and portfolio optimizations.

---

## 🚀 Goals

- 🔍 Retrieve cryptocurrency-related Twitter data using relevant hashtags.
- 🧠 Classify tweet sentiments using machine learning models; benchmark against VADER and rule-based approaches.
- 📈 Incorporate sentiment as an exogenous variable in time series forecasting models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM).
- 💹 Design, backtest, and evaluate sentiment-driven cryptocurrency trading strategies.
- 🧮 Optimize a crypto-cash portfolio under varying risk constraints using MATLAB's Financial Toolbox.

## 🧠 Workflow

### 1. Data Retrieval
- Connect to Twitter using MATLAB’s API interface.
- Fetch tweets containing crypto-related hashtags such as `#Bitcoin`, `#Crypto`, `#Ethereum`.

### 2. Sentiment Analysis
- Preprocess tweets: remove noise, tokenize, and normalize.
- Train and evaluate ML models such as:
  - Naive Bayes
  - Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Compare outputs with:
  - VADER sentiment scores
  - Rule-based (positive/negative word ratio) scoring
- Optional: Use a Large Language Model via API for improved contextual understanding.

### 3. Feature Extraction
- Aggregate tweet metrics over time intervals:
  - Tweet Volume
  - Average Sentiment Score
  - Sentiment Volatility

### 4. Time Series Modeling
- Build models like:
  - **ARIMA** (Econometrics Toolbox)
  - **LSTM** (Deep Learning Toolbox)
- Use sentiment features as exogenous regressors.
- Evaluate model accuracy using metrics like:
  - RMSE
  - MAPE
  - MAE

### 5. Trading Strategy & Portfolio Optimization
- Design algorithmic trading strategies based on sentiment trends.
- Backtest using historical cryptocurrency price data.
- Optimize crypto-cash portfolios using MATLAB’s **Financial Toolbox**.
- Evaluate performance using metrics like:
  - Cumulative Returns
  - Sharpe Ratio
  - Drawdown Analysis

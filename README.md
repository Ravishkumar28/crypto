🪙 Sentiment Analysis in Cryptocurrency Trading
Project Number: 239
Level: Master's / Doctoral
Keywords: Cryptocurrency, Twitter Sentiment, MATLAB, NLP, Trading Strategy, Time Series

📌 Objective
To develop optimized cryptocurrency trading strategies using Twitter sentiment analysis, integrating Natural Language Processing (NLP), Machine Learning, and Time Series modeling within the MATLAB environment.

🚀 Goals
Retrieve Twitter data for cryptocurrency sentiment.
Classify sentiments using ML models and compare with VADER and rule-based methods.
Use sentiment data as external variables in time series forecasting.
Design, backtest, and evaluate trading strategies informed by sentiment signals.
Optimize a crypto-cash portfolio under various risk levels.
🔧 Tools & Technologies
MATLAB Toolboxes:

Datafeed Toolbox™
Text Analytics Toolbox™
Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox™

🧠 Workflow
Data Retrieval
Use MATLAB’s Twitter API connection to collect tweets with crypto-related hashtags.
Sentiment Analysis
Clean and tokenize text.
Train ML classifiers (e.g., Naive Bayes, SVM).
Compare with VADER and Ratio Rule sentiment scores.
Feature Extraction
Extract tweet volume, average sentiment score, and tweet volatility.
Integrate Large Language Model via MATLAB API (optional).
Time Series Modeling
Build ARIMA and LSTM models using sentiment as a regressor.
Evaluate with RMSE, MAPE, and other metrics.
Trading Strategy & Backtesting
Design strategy using sentiment-informed signals.
Optimize portfolio using Financial Toolbox.
Backtest using historical price data and evaluate performance.
🔁 Extensions
Add Python integration to bypass Twitter API data range limitations.
Use Reinforcement Learning for dynamic portfolio management.
Build an interactive MATLAB app for live strategy simulation.
Apply the same methodology to equity or fixed-income markets.
